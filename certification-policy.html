            This key is not published on keyservers. The current version can be 
            found <a href="https://www.gonz0.com.ar/gpg/public-key.asc">here</a>.
            The email address on this web page has been removed to prevent 
            spamming. On the actual key, the address is present.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="location"></a>Location</h2>
        <p>
            I live on Uruguay's capital city of Montevideo. Here, I'm available for key 
            signing at any time. I'm also listed on 
            <a href="http://biglumber.com/x/web?pk=607D555B2B11B1B3916ACBDE31E5FE63E2FC4825">
            biglumber</a>, a site about key signing coordination.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="levels"></a>Signature levels</h2>
        <p>
            The level I'll use to sign each UID depends on how confidently can 
            I state that someone is who he or she claims to be.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Level 3</dt>
            <dd>
                This level will only be given to people I know long enough to 
                be absolutely sure of their identity. Mostly friends, family 
                and long term co-workers will receive this level of signature.
            </dd>
            <dt>Level 2</dt>
            <dd>
                This signature level is assigned to those people who contacted 
                me for key signing and succeeded in providing <a href="#proof">
                reasonable proof of identity</a> although I do not know them.
            </dd>
            <dt>Levels 1 and 0</dt>
            <dd>I won't be using these levels for the time being.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2><a id="proof"></a>Proof of identity</h2>
        <p>
            To prove an identity, I request a meeting in person, to which the 
            <acronym title="the person willing to get their key signed">
            signee</acronym> must attend with an identity card featuring a 
            photo id; he or she must also provide a piece of paper with their 
            key's fingerprint on, and a list of all UIDs I'm requested to sign. 
            I will accept handwritten information, although I won't sign a UID 
            if I cannot understand it, nor will I sign any UID if the 
            fingerprint is not clear enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the meeting, I'll compare the picture on the identity card 
            with the person's face, and take note of the name on it. I'll also 
            keep the piece of paper with the keys' information to validate the 
            keys I should sign.
        </p>
        <p>
            These proceedings are not required for people I know long enough 
            to discard identity forgery. In those cases, I'll requiere only 
            that they hand me their fingerprints in person, to avoid man in the 
            middle attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I need access to the public key I'm signing. If it's not 
            available on keyservers, I expect to receive it somehow: be it an 
            URL from where to grab it, or email, or any other means. From the 
            time I receive the key on, I'll be sending every email encrypted if 
            the key has an encryption subkey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the meeting is over, and I'm back at my place, I'll send 
            random pieces of data to the email addresses listed on the UIDs I'm 
            requested to sign. I expect to receive them back, signed by the key 
            I'm signing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the email challenge/response is successfully completed, I'll 
            be sending an email with each signed UID signed by my key, 
            according to my <a href="#levels">signature levels policy</a>.

                Did change the versioning scheme. As I'll be updating this page at least 
                yearly, it seems reasonable to use the year number as part of the version.
                Added encryption subkey 0xA1F017BE to replace 0xD8BF382F which is about 
                to expire.

                Big changes. Level 1 signatures are gone (I issued none 
                anyways); the signing process for people I know long enough is 
                now stated out loud; and the challenge/response part now 
                explains that if one UID fails, the whole key fails.
