        <h2><a id="keys"></a>Key(s) affected by this policy</h2>
        <p>This policy is valid for all signatures made by the following 
           GnuPG key:</p>
        <pre class="openpgpkey">
pub   4096R/E2FC4825 2006-07-24
      Key fingerprint = 607D 555B 2B11 B1B3 916A  CBDE 31E5 FE63 E2FC 4825
uid                  Gonzalo Berm&uacute;dez &lt;&gt;

        </pre>
        <p>This key is not published on keyservers. The current version 
can be found <a href="public_key.asc">here</a>. The email address on this 
web page has been removed to prevent spamming. On the actual key, the address 
is present.</p>
        <h2><a id="location"></a>Where am I</h2>
        <p>I live on Argentina's Federal District. Here, I'm available for key 
signing at any time. Also, I'll be publishing any travels I do or events I 
attend to on <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=
7nvjfntgorknh2d1kus2iq1nmg%40group.calendar.google.com">my Key Signing 
Coordination Google Calendar</a>.</p>
        <h2><a id="levels"></a>Signature levels</h2>
        <p>The level I'll use to sign each UID depends on how well I can 
assure someone is who he or she claims to be.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Level 3</dt>
            <dd>This level will only be given to people I know long enough to 
be absolutely sure of their identity. Mostly friends, family and long term 
co-workers will receive this level of signature.</dd>
            <dt>Level 2</dt>
            <dd>This signature level is assigned to those UIDs of people who 
contacted me for key signing, succeeded in providing <a href="#proof">
reasonable proof of identity</a> although I do not know them, and have the 
owner's real name on them.</dd>
            <dt>Level 1</dt>
            <dd>Signatures of level 1 are given to those UIDs from people who 
<a href="#proof">prove their identity</a>, are not known to me, and have a 
pseudonym, company name or anything else than a real name on them. Note that I 
require at least one UID with the real name on the key to sign it.</dd>
            <dt>Level 0</dt>
            <dd>I won't use signatures of level 0.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2><a id="proof"></a>Proof of identity</h2>
        <p>To prove an identity, I request a meeting in person, to which the 
<i>signee</i> (the person willing to get their key signed) must attend with a 
passport, identity card, driver's license or the like, featuring a photo id; he 
or she must also provide a piece of paper with their key's fingerprint on, and 
a list of all UIDs I'm requested to sign. I will accept handwritten 
information, although I won't sign an UID if I cannot understand it, nor will 
I sign any UID if the fingerprint is not clear enough.</p>
        <p>During the meeting, I'll compare the picture on the identity card 
with the person's face, and take note of the name on it. I'll also keep the 
piece of paper with the keys' information to validate the key which I should 
sign.</p>
        <p>Of course, I need access to the public key I'm signing. If it's not 
available on keyservers, I expect to receive it somehow: be it an URL from 
where to grab it, or email, or whatever. From the time I receive the key on, 
I'll be sending every email encrypted if the key has an encryption subkey.</p>
        <p>Once the meeting is over, and I'm back at home, I'll send random 
pieces of data to the email addresses listed on the UIDs I'm requested to 
sign. I expect to receive them back, signed by the key I'm signing.</p>
        <p>For each UID for which the email challenge/response is successfully 
completed, I'll be sending an email with it signed by my key, according to my 
<a href="#levels">signature levels policy</a>.</p>
